# Overview
This project aims to construct a Modern Data Pipeline using COVID-19 data for Caladan, a fictitious midsize country with a population of 3.2 million. Our task is to assist government leaders in developing a policy plan. The objective is to mitigate the impact of the virus while maintaining minimal restrictions. The primary goal is to identify policies that can keep the growth rate of deaths below 1% and the growth rate of new cases below 3% over a 30-day rolling average.
